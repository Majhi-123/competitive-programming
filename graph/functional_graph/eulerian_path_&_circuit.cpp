//for undirecte graph--
//Euler path- start from any node and end on any node
//only 2 nodes have odd no. of degree and rest have even degree ------>1 for in,  1 for exit
//Euler tour - start on one node and end on same node
//all nodes have even no. of degrees

//for directed graph--
//Euler path- 1 node has (in_deg-out_deg) == 1 && (out_deg-in_deg)==1 , rest have in_deg == out_deg
//Euler tour - each node has in_deg == out_deg
